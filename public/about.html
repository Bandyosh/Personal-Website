    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>I started the process of learning about coding a long time ago. Firstly, in order to understand what was actually happening when you write code, took me a while to grasp. In order to build a somewhat foundation I turned to a program called Scratch. This program enabled me to understand code in terms of English, which was something that seemed impossible at the time. From there, I slowly understand the syntax of Javascript and how to turn English words into code. Thus began my journey of writing "hello world!" many times and paving the path to learning new languages. </p>

    <h3>Cats</h3>
    <p>I have two cats. Twyla is the tabby and the caleico is called Tizzy. Both of whom LOVE playing for hours to a end. Twyla who is around 9 months older than Tizzy is extremly shy toward new people and hates car rides with a passion. Whereas, Tizzy loves people (new or old) and she dislikes car rides but does not hate it.</p>

    <h3>Travel</h3>
<p>As someone from India, I LOVE traveling to my home country. It is one of the only times I can shut off the rest of the world and forget about my own problems. I also love traveling around my continent and going to places like New York, Chicago, Ontario, and so much more. Traveling is a big part of my life and is my main method of relieving stress. </p>
